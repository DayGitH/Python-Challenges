[8/27/2012] Challenge #92 [difficult] (Bags and balls)

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/ywm28/8272012_challenge_92_difficult_bags_and_balls/

Compute all the permutations of placing 9 balls into 4 bags such that each bag contains an odd number of balls.
Ball count is transient when placing bags within one another. For example, a bag containing 3 balls is placed inside a
bag containing 2 balls. The inner bag contains 3 balls and the outer bag contains 5 balls.
Some example permutations:
    ((((9))))
    (8(((1))))
    (1)(1)((7))
