[Weekly #17] Mini Challenges

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2mkh5g/weekly_17_mini_challenges/

So this week mini challenges. Too small for an easy but great for a mini challenge. Here is your chance to post some
good warm up mini challenges. How it works. Start a new main thread in here. Use my formatting (or close to it) -- if
you want to solve a mini challenge you reply off that thread. Simple. Keep checking back all week as people will keep
posting challenges and solve the ones you want.
Please check other mini challenges before posting one to avoid duplications within a certain reason.
