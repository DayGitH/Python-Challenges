[Weekly #7] Programming Tools -- The Editors

# Weekly 7:
For the most part at the core of programming you need a text editor. Then you might run your program through a
compiler/linker/etc. Over time we have been merging these into 1 program. So now you edit your program and link your
libraries in and compile it and debug your program all in one nice program.
What are your development tools/process? Are they language dependent? What are some tools that you don't use often but
would like to give a shout out too with a link for people to see?
