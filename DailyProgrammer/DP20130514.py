[05/14/13] WINNERS: Week-Long Challenge #2

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1ebu5l/051413_winners_weeklong_challenge_2/

Hey r/DailyProgrammers,
**Congratulations to our awesome community-member /u/Skeeto**! Skeeto submitted the winning solution to our [previous
week's hard
challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1dk7c7/05213_challenge_121_hard_medal_management/), which
was also our second week-long challenge. He has won three months of Reddit gold, a gold medal in his user flair, and
our enormous thanks for helping the moderators with better managing our growing community!
For the sake of being transparent with the community, Skeeto was the only submitter to the challenge in question.
Regardless, his solution fits the challenge's requirements and is frankly well written; the rewards are truly well
deserved and his work is also well appreciated by the mods! In the future, we will work hard to lower the barrier of
entry for these kind of challenges, so next time we should get some more involvement.
Expect regular [Hard]-level challenges to return to normal starting this week. We *will* continue to have week-long
challenges, but spaced out to every month or two.
Good luck, and have fun programming!
