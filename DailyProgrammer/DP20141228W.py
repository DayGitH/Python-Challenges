[Weekly #18] Holiday Code - a time of sharing

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2q2zxe/weekly_18_holiday_code_a_time_of_sharing/

Happy Holidays everyone (lots of holidays)
This time of year is known for its sharing of gifts with others. In our community we often share code through the idea
of open source. The two can work well. So for this week share some code. Anything. It can be useful, a neat trick, a go
to design of code you find you use a lot. Or you can point people in the direction of some favorite web spots you check
for code.
Have a great Holiday season everyone && Happy New Years (++Year)
