[Weekly #22] Machine Learning

# [](#WeeklyIcon) Asimov would be proud!
[Machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is a diverse field spanning from optimization and
data classification, to computer vision and pattern recognition. Modern algorithms for detecting spam email use machine
learning to react to developing types of spam and spot them quicker than people could!
Techniques include evolutionary programming and genetic algorithms, and models such as [artificial neural
networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). Do you work in any of these fields, or study them in
academics? Do you know something about them that's interesting, or have any cool resources or videos to share? Show
them to the world!
Libraries like [OpenCV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV) (available [here](http://opencv.org/)) use machine
learning to some extent, in order to adapt to new situations. The United Kingdom makes extensive use of [automatic
number plate recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police-enforced_ANPR_in_the_UK) on speed cameras, which is a
subset of optical character recognition that needs to work in high speeds and poor visibility.
Of course, there's also /r/MachineLearning if you want to check out even more. They have a [simple questions
thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/2xopnm/mondays_simple_questions_thread_20150302/) if you want
some reading material!
