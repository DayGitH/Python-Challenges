[Discussion] Challenge tags [Easy] [Intermediate] [Hard]

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/28kl7b/discussion_challenge_tags_easy_intermediate_hard/

Hello Dailyprogrammers. 
There has been some talk amongst moderators about our Challenge tags. These tags are the [Easy] [Intermediate] and
[Hard]. As tradition holds we try to post challenges that fit these tags. The challenges progress from easy to hard
across the week.
As many of you might have seen sometimes we might post a "easy" and it seems "intermediate" or we might do a "hard"
that comes across "easy".
The idea is instead of trying to develop challenges based on difficulty which is very subjective and different from
person to person and instead just post 3 challenges a week and let programmers decide for themselves.
Thoughts? Ideas? Should we continue the tradition of 2+ years of easy, intermediate, hard or try a different approach?
**EDIT - Update 7-2-2013**
So going forward we will continue to tag the Challenges Easy/Intermediate/Hard. 
You might see on Fridays an "Easy" or "Intermediate" one in place of "Hard". "Hard" Challenges can be tough to develop
while there are many easy/intermediate ones to be done.
Thank you all for your feedback!
