"""
Write a program that given a floating point number, gives the number of American dollar coins and bills needed to
represent that number (rounded to the nearest 1/100, i.e. the nearest penny). For instance, if the float is 12.33, the
result would be 1 ten-dollar bill, 2 one-dollar bills, 1 quarter, 1 nickel and 3 pennies.

For the purposes of this problem, these are the different denominations of the currency and their values:

    Penny: 1 cent
    Nickel: 5 cent
    Dime: 10 cent
    Quarter: 25 cent
    One-dollar bill
    Five-dollar bill
    Ten-dollar bill
    Fifty-dollar bill
    Hundred-dollar bill

Sorry Thomas Jefferson, JFK and Sacagawea, but no two-dollar bills, half-dollars or dollar coins!

Your program can return the result in whatever format it wants, but I recommend just returning a list giving the number
each coin or bill needed to make up the change. So, for instance, 12.33 could return [0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3] (here the
denominations are ordered from most valuable, the hundred-dollar bill, to least valuable, the penny)

    Thanks to Medicalizawhat for submitting this problem in /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas! And on behalf of the moderators,
    I'd like to thank everyone who submitted problems the last couple of days, it's been really helpful, and there are
    some great problems there! Keep it up, it really helps us out a lot!
