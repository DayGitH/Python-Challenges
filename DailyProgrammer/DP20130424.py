[04/24/13] EXTENSIONS: Week-Long Challenge #1 due FRIDAY!

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1d0qnm/042413_extensions_weeklong_challenge_1_due_friday/

Hey r/DailyProgrammers,
I'm *still* receiving a bunch of challenge submissions; so much so, I'm going to do one final extension: the challenge
(making a (tiny) video game) concludes Friday, at midnight, here in the American Pacific Time zone (so that's GMT -
7:00). This is the final extensions, though you guys are creating some amazing submissions! Expect the results posted
and rewards received a day or two after.
Don't forget the prizes: **We will award the most unique game, most impressive game, and best demo with +1 gold ribbons
to your flair. Winners get Reddit Gold.**
As a final note: [Ludum Dare #26](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) starts this weekend. It's the same general idea, but
much more open-ended, and all in a weekend! Check our /r/LudumDare for Reddit-specific groups.
