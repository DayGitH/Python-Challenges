[8/13/2012] Challenge #88 [difficult] (ASCII art)


https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/y5t0y/8132012_challenge_88_difficult_ascii_art/

Write a program that given an image file, produces an ASCII-art version of that image. Try it out on
[Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/tJmB9.png) (note that the background is transparent, not white). There's no requirement that
the ASCII-art be particularly good, it only needs to be good enough so that you recognize the original image in there. 
* Thanks to [akaritakai](http://www.reddit.com/user/akaritakai) for suggesting this problem at /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas!
