Weekly #26 - Mini Challenges

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/56mfgz/weekly_26_mini_challenges/

So this week, let's do some mini challenges. Too small for an easy but great for a mini challenge. Here is your chance
to post some good warm up mini challenges. How it works. Start a new main thread in here. 
if you post a challenge, here's a template from /u/lengau for anyone wanting to post challenges (you can copy/paste
this text rather than having to get the source):
`**[CHALLENGE NAME]** - [CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION]`
` `
`**Given:** [INPUT DESCRIPTION]`
` `
`**Output:** [EXPECTED OUTPUT DESCRIPTION]`
` `
`**Special:** [ANY POSSIBLE SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS]`
` `
`**Challenge input:** [SAMPLE INPUT]`
` `
If you want to solve a mini challenge you reply in that thread. Simple. Keep checking back all week as people will keep
posting challenges and solve the ones you want.
Please check other mini challenges before posting one to avoid duplications within a certain reason.
