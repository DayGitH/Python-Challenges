"""
Write a program or a function that can print out arbitrarily sized smiley face in ascii art. The smiley face can be
however you want, but the eyes can't be single points (that is, they have to be circles at large size). Your program
should be able to take in an integer between 16 and 1000 that represents the dimensions to render the face.

Here is a sample output.
