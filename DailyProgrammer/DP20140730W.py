[Weekly #4] Variable Names

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2byh4e/weekly_4_variable_names/

# Variable Names:
We use variables a lot in our programs. Over the many years I have seen and been told a wide range of "accepted" use of
names for variables. I always found the techniques/methods/reasons interesting and different.
What are some of your standards for naming variables? 
Details like are they language specific (do you change between languages) are good to share. Or what causes the names
to be as they are.
