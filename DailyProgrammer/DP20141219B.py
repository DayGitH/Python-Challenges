# [](#IntermediateIcon) **(Intermediate)**: 50,000 Subscriber Meta-challenge
Congratulations to everyone for getting the subreddit to 50K subscribers! As a reward I'll do a nice relaxed meta
challenge. Effective communication is an important skill to have, but it certainly isn't easy; hence, it is a challenge
unto itself. This also gives less experienced members of the subreddit a chance to see into the minds of the more
veteran submitters.
# Challenge
Pick your favourite solution (that you have written) to a past challenge, or one that you are particularly proud of. It
can be from any challenge, but preferably one with some complexity. Now, describe how it works (via in-code comments or
otherwise) as you would to a person. Then, describe how you might improve it or do it differently in hindsight. Also,
link to the challenge post itself.
# Thanks
That's to all of you - even those not currently subscribed. Without your support, this subreddit wouldn't be where it
is right now. You *are* the creators of DailyProgrammer - carry on being awesome!
