[Weekly #15] Architectural Patterns

Let's say you're taking on a larger project than usual. It spans multiple files/namespaces and requires a large variety
of different components to all slot in together. What approach do you take?
I personally believe that for any large scale project, you need an OO approach, Although [John
Carmack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PhArSujR_A) did state that functional code, whilst slow in the beginning has
a significant return in the long run. 
What about you? How do you go about your projects?
