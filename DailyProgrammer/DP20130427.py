[04/27/13] WINNERS: Week-Long Challenge #1

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1d9a8t/042713_winners_weeklong_challenge_1/

Hey r/DailyProgrammers,
As always, great job! I've gone through every submission and actually made time to play every game.. I'm blown away by
the unique ideas and quality of work put out there.
With that said, the winners especially went above and beyond, so I'm happy to announce them:
For the **most unique game**, user **/u/bh3 wins!**. He/she developed a full Ti-Basic interpreter (which was well
designed, IMHO), and then wrote a few games *on top of that*. This is a fun twist and an awesome interpretation of the
challenge description!
For the **most impressive game**, user **/u/KrazyTheFox wins!** He/she wrote a very fluid, very smooth standard
platformer. Playing it _feels_ like playing an old TI-83+ game; he/she gets massive points for giving a great feeling
of nostalgia.
For the **best demo**, user **/u/skeeto wins!** He/she wrote a classic snake game implementation, but what's
particularly cool about the app is it has two demos (3D geometry and a texture-noise generation) in the splash screen.
Clean, simple, and elegant!
All three winners will be receiving Reddit Gold within 24 hours. Nicely done!
Again, thank you all for participating; it's been a blast going through the submissions and playing your games. The mod
team will definitely do these week-long challenges more often. Happy weekend!
