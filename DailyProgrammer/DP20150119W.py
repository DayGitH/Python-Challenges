[Weekly #20] Paradigms

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2sx7nn/weekly_20_paradigms/

So recently there has been a massive surge in the interest of functional programming, but let's not forget the other
paradigms too!
* Object oriented
* Imperative
* Logic (Prolog)
There are more than I have listed above, but how do you feel about these paradigms? 
What's a paradigm you've had interest in but not the time to explore?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of these in both development and in the real-world? 
Slightly off-topic but I would love to hear of anyone that started programming functionally versus the usual
imperative/OOP route.
