[04/22/13] REMINDER: Week-Long Challenge #1 due today!

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1cv8oo/042213_reminder_weeklong_challenge_1_due_today/

Hey r/DailyProgrammers,
As a friendly reminder, our first week-long challenge (making a (tiny) video game) concludes today, at midnight, here
in the American Pacific Time zone (so that's GMT - 7:00).
We've got about 6 submissions, so half of all submissions at-this-moment are essentially guaranteed winning already! If
enough people post at the last minute, I may extend submissions by a few hours up to 24 hours at most.
Don't forget the prizes: **We will award the most unique game, most impressive game, and best demo with +1 gold ribbons
to your flair. Winners get Reddit Gold.**
