[Weekly #12] Learning a new language

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2h5u7q/weekly_12_learning_a_new_language/

There are many ways to learn a new language. Books. Online videos. Classes. Virtual online Classes. In addition there
are many supports to learning the language. Google searching questions you have to find answers (lot of them list hits
on stackoverflow.com)
This we week we share these methods/books/websites/suggestions on learning that new language or a language you post to
get some daily programmer user tips for.
Before posting - search for the language first in this topic and add to that thread of discussion. So try to avoid 20
threads about "python" for example. Add to the python one.
* Pick 1 language - start a thread on it with just the name of that language (could be one you know or one you want to
know.
* Add to that thread (reply to the 1st comment on the language) list some good tips on learning that language. Maybe a
book. Classes. Website. subreddit. Whatever.
* Shared experience. For example learning objective C I would list some websites/books that help me but I might add a
story about how I found always having the api documentation up and ready to use in front of me as I did classes/read
books was very helpful.
* Or if you have a "in general" tip - go ahead and add a general tip of learning languages. Insight shared is very
valued
