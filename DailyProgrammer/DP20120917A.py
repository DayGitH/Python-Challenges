[9/17/2012] Challenge #99 [easy] (Words with letters in alphabetical order)

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/101m7y/9172012_challenge_99_easy_words_with_letters_in/

How many words contained in [this
dictionary](http://code.google.com/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads/detail?name=enable1.txt) have their letters in
alphabetical order? So, for instance the letters in "ghost" and "bee" is in alphabetical order, but the letters in
"cab" are not.
