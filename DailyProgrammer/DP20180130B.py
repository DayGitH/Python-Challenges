[2018-01-30] Challenge #349 [Intermediate] Packing Stacks of Boxes

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7ubc70/20180130_challenge_349_intermediate_packing/

# Description
You run a moving truck business, and you can pack the most in your truck when you have stacks of equal size - no slack
space. So, you're an enterprising person, and you want to write some code to help you along. 
# Input Description
You'll be given two numbers per line. The first number is the number of stacks of boxes to yield. The second is a list
of boxes, one integer per size, to pack. 
Example:
	3 34312332
That says "make three stacks of boxes with sizes 3, 4, 3, 1 etc". 
# Output Description
Your program should emit the stack of boxes as a series of integers, one stack per line. From the above example:
	331
	322
	34
If you can't make equal sized stacks, your program should emit nothing. 
# Challenge Input
	3 912743471352
	3 42137586
	9 2 
	4 064876318535318
# Challenge Output
	9124
	7342
	7135
	426
	138
	75
	(nothing)
	
	0665
	4733
	8315
	881
# Notes
I posted a challenge a couple of hours ago that turned out to be a duplicate, so I deleted it. I apologize for any
confusion I caused. 
**EDIT** Also I fouled up the sample input, it should ask for 3 stacks, not two. Thanks everyone.
