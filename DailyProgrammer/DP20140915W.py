https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ggunp/weekly_11_challenges_you_want/

#Weekly 11:
This topic is about what challenges you are seeking.
* Any type of algorithm/data structures you want to be challenged on?
* Any type -- like string/math/database/graphics/simulation/AI?
More or less what do you want to see. The mods read this and so this is your chance to give your input. We try to post
challenges the community for the most part will enjoy doing but this feedback always helps in our choices.
thanks!
