[11/6/2012] Challenge #111 [Difficult] The Josephus Problem

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/12qicm/1162012_challenge_111_difficult_the_josephus/

Flavius Josephus was a roman historian of Jewish origin. During the Jewish-Roman wars of the first century AD, he was
in a cave with fellow soldiers, 41 men in all, surrounded by enemy Roman troops. They decided to commit suicide by
standing in a ring and counting off each third man. Each man so designated was to commit suicide. (When the count came
back around the ring, soldiers who had already committed suicide were skipped in the counting.) Josephus, not wanting
to die, placed himself in position #31, which was the last position to be chosen.
In the general version of the problem, there are n soldiers numbered from 1 to n and each k-th soldier will be
eliminated. The count starts from the first soldier. Write a function to find, given n and k, the number of the last
survivor. For example, `josephus(41, 3) = 31`. Find `josephus(123456789101112, 13)`.
Thanks to user __zebuilin__ for suggesting this problem in /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas!
