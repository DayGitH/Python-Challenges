# [](#WeeklyIcon) The long tail of \/r/DailyProgrammer...
/u/gfixler pointed out a few weeks ago in /r/DailyProgrammer_Ideas that some people don't get a chance to make their
solutions known if they posted it some time after the challenge was released (see the original thread
[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer_ideas/comments/2y2crh/the_long_tail_of_rdailyprogrammer/)). Solutions
posted after the 'gold rush' of initial responses get buried, which is a bit disheartening if you submit your solution
comment later on!
In this week's Weekly post, you've now got a chance to talk about any cool solutions to older challenges you may have
(as old as you like!), or continue any discussions that were going on. If this idea is popular, this Recap thread might
become a recurring thing.
### IRC
Remember, we have an [IRC channel](/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2dtqr7/) on FreeNode: **#reddit-dailyprogrammer**.
There's usually a discussion occurring there every evening (GMT). Head on over for a continual discussion!
### Previous
The previous weekly thread was [**Paradigms**](/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2sx7nn//).
