[8/27/2014] Contest #1 - IDE Intellisense

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2eplay/8272014_contest_1_ide_intellisense/

#Description
An IDE is one of the most useful and productive environments to program in. Sometimes though, you're casually
programming in [LOLCODE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE) but there's no intellisense and you can't remember if
LOLCODE uses snake_case or camelCase. This is probably because it wasn't the highest of priorities to support this
language. 
#Task
Your task, is :
Given an IDE of your choosing, create an intellisense plugin for a language of your choice.
This will prove a larger challenge in some environments than others. Sublime Text is basically a JSON file whilst
Visual Studio's intellisense is a giant program in itself.
#Rules
Remember
* No editing the code after the submission date.
If you want to edit and fix the code after the submission date, either do it locally, or wait a week (in this case the
7th of October) and then you can push your changes through to the world wide web.
#Deadline
To allow a good amount of time for everyone the deadline shall be the 1st of October 2014. This means that students on
holidays can crank it out in no time and also the guys working 9-5 have some time too.
#Submitting your code
Either submit it here, or on a repo of your choice. We all like Github though ;D
If you're feeling very generous, share a video of your intellisense in action!
There's a great free screen recorder called [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) , no watermarks or
limitations!
#Award
For now, you will be awarded one months reddit gold. There is still a chance that we can get a better award but a
months gold is the bare minimum you will be receiving.
#Notes
Struggling?
Your IDE probably has documentation on the exact thing you're trying to do, poke around and see what you find. If you
find something useful, post it for others to see!
If you can't think of a language to create a plug-in for, there seems to be a large demand for a decent intellisense
plugin for Haskell.
#Finally
We're always on the IRC channel on [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/) . Our channel is **#reddit-dailyprogrammer**
There's usually ~20 or so people on at any given moment, stop by!
