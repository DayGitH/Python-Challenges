[2018-01-10] Challenge #346 [Intermediate] Fermat's little theorem

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7pmt9c/20180110_challenge_346_intermediate_fermats/

#Description
Most introductionary implementations for testing the primality of a number have a time complexity of`O(n**0.5)`.
For large numbers this is not a feasible strategy, for example testing a
[400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number) digit number.
Fermat's little theorem states:
>  If p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number `a**p − a` is an integer multiple of p. 
This can also be stated as `(a**p) % p = a`
If n is not prime, then, in general, most of the numbers a < n will not satisfy the above relation. This leads to the
following algorithm for testing primality: Given a number n, pick a random number a < n and compute the remainder of
a**n modulo n. If the result is not equal to a, then n is certainly not prime. If it is a, then chances are good that n
is prime. Now pick another random number a and test it with the same method. If it also satisfies the equation, then we
can be even more confident that n is prime. By trying more and more values of a, we can increase our confidence in the
result. This algorithm is known as the Fermat test.
If n passes the test for some random choice of a, the chances are better than even that n is prime. If n passes the
test for two random choices of a, the chances are better than 3 out of 4 that n is prime. By running the test with more
and more randomly chosen values of a we can make the probability of error as small as we like.
Create a program to do Fermat's test on a number, given a required certainty. Let the power of the modulo guide you.
#Formal Inputs & Outputs
##Input description
Each line a number to test, and the required certainty.
##Output description
Return True or False
#Bonus
There do exist numbers that fool the Fermat test: numbers n that are not prime and yet have the property that a**n is
congruent to a modulo n for all integers a < n. Such numbers are extremely rare, so the Fermat test is quite reliable
in practice. Numbers that fool the Fermat test are called Carmichael numbers, and little is known about them other than
that they are extremely rare. There are 255 Carmichael numbers below 100,000,000.
There are variants of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled by these. Implement one.
