[Weekly #8] Sorting algorithms

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2emixb/weekly_8_sorting_algorithms/

#Weekly Topic:
Often times we need to sort the data. A basic foundation in learning programming is to understand how to do this sort
on the data and why to do it. Monday we saw a challenge based on the very popular Quick Sort algorithm.
But let's talk about sorting in more detail. Sorting routines best fit the need. Sometimes we need a quicksort but
sometimes thou a different sorting algorithm should be done. 
Where/how/what do you do to sort? Give some examples of some challenges where perhaps a different sorting approach is
used/needed. Why does it work better? How do you determine which sorting algorithm to use?
Also this is a chance to point out some other algorithms perhaps out there but not used much or talked about much.
Maybe you still like bubble sort even if it is not always the optimal choice. Why?
