[10/25/2012] Challenge #107 [Easy] (All possible decodings)

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/122c4t/10252012_challenge_107_easy_all_possible_decodings/

Consider the translation from letters to numbers `a -> 1` through `z -> 26`. Every sequence of letters can be
translated into a string of numbers this way, with the numbers being mushed together. For instance `hello -> 85121215`.
Unfortunately the reverse translation is not unique. `85121215` could map to `hello`, but also to `heaubo`. Write a
program that, given a string of digits, outputs every possible translation back to letters.
Sample input:
`  123`
Sample output:
`  abc`
`  aw`
`  lc`
Thanks to __ashashwat__ for posting this idea in /r/dailyprogrammer_ideas!
