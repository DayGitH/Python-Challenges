[Weekly #2] Pre-coding Work

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ao9y3/weekly_2_precoding_work/

#Weekly Topic #2:
What work do you do before coding your solution? What kind of planning or design work if any do you do? How do you do
it? Paper and pencil? Draw a picture? Any online/web based tools?
Give some examples of your approach to handling the dailyprogrammer challenges and your process that occurs before you
start coding.
