[2017-04-12] Challenge #310 [Intermediate] Simplifying square roots

https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/64y4cf/20170412_challenge_310_intermediate_simplifying/

#Description
Simplify square roots in the form `(a sqrt(b))/(c sqrt(d))`. A simplified radical should have no square roots in the
denominator and no number in a square root should have a square factor. For example, the input `2 5 5 10` for `a b c
d`, respectively, should simplify to `1 2 5` where a=1, b=2, and c=5.
#Output description
 
     a b c 
(d should not exist after simplifying)
  
#Challenge input
    45 1465 26 15
#Challenge output
    15 879 26
