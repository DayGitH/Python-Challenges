#Title: Now for Something Upside down
#Description: 
The [Easy] Challenge was delayed 1 day to be on April's Fools Day this week so the moderators could attempt to be
clever and turn things upside down by making a super easy challenge to decode a message to just have people post hello
world programs. The responses to that challenge was interesting.
To show how things got turned upside down this week's [Hard] challenge we are gonna make text appear upside down.
#Input:
* 1 to many lines of text to convert
* You must read it in from standard input or a file. (No fixed strings hard coded into the program with the input)
* Can handle as input by characters for converting [a-z] [A-Z] [ ] [?!.] [0-9] to upside down characters.
##Example:
    This is some text that I am writing!
    Soon it will be just 4 lines of upside down text.
    How did they do it? 
    We will all know soon.
#Output:
The text modified to be upside down.
##Example:
    ˙uoos ʍouʞ llɐ llᴉʍ ǝM
     ¿ʇᴉ op ʎǝɥʇ pᴉp ʍoH
    ˙ʇxǝʇ uʍop ǝpᴉsdn ɟo sǝuᴉl ㄣ ʇsnɾ ǝq llᴉʍ ʇᴉ uooS
    ¡ƃuᴉʇᴉɹʍ ɯɐ I ʇɐɥʇ ʇxǝʇ ǝɯos sᴉ sᴉɥ┴
#Notes:
* As part of the [Hard] challenge we leave it to you to figure out how this is possible.
* Solutions might limit which languages you can use.
#More Challenges
In addition to above look into trying these out:
* convert upside down to normal
* find conversions for $&@';/\><+*=_- if any are possible
* given a word search the text count the word matches. Count how many times the word is normal or upside down
